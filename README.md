# Coding Challenge - University Search

This is a web application project built to search universities based on https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list API.
There are 3 tabs in this application:
1. Search - to search & mark universities as favorites based on names
2. Favorites - to see all the universities marked as favorites
